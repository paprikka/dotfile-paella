## Overview

The `.zshrc ` file contains a bunch of utilities and aliases that survived my dotfile spring cleaning, which means that I actually use them.

You can find the use cases as well as the setup instructions in the dotfile itself. 

## Setup

I keep the file in `~/.zshrc-custom/.zshrc` and load it using `source ~/.zshrc-custom/.zshrc`.

Honestly, you won't need everything from this list.
